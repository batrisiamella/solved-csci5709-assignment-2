Assignment 2 focuses on planning the front-end and back-end functionality of an application. In particular, this assignment requires for you to consider the application of back-end development techniques, approaches, and APIs, for defining the functionality of a web application based on a given set of requirements. More specifically, in this assignment you will be planning for the back-end functionality of ONE (1) feature required for your group project. <strong>You are encouraged to coordinate the features you will be planning for with members of your group, as each member is expected to focus their assignment on different features.</strong>

<strong>As part of this assignment, you will also have to provide justifications for the choices you make,</strong> e.g., Back-End Frameworks or APIs used, Information Architecture, Data Management methods, data format used, process workflows, etc. Finally, it goes without saying that any instance of <strong>academic dishonesty</strong> will be reported. As such, make sure you cite any external work or sources throughout your assignment.

<strong>Learning Objectives: </strong>

<ol>

 <li>To assess the application of suitable Back-End APIs and Frameworks for the purpose of developing a prototype application, given a set of proposed guidelines (e.g., wireframes, devices, expected functionality).</li>

 <li>To coordinate with group members the work allocation required for this assignment submission.</li>

 <li>To compare different development techniques, approaches, APIs, workflows, etc. in order to judge their suitability for the development of a specific web application given a set of application requirements.</li>

</ol>

<strong>Requirements: </strong>

For your Assignment 2, you must do the following:

<strong>A2.1.  Application Features </strong>

Meet with members of your group and <strong>Choose ONE (1) feature</strong> from the list of features your group defined as required features for your project (e.g., Profile Management, Permission Management, File Transfer System, Recommender System, Shopping Cart, etc) in your group project Proposal.

Additionally, each group member is expected to choose a different feature. You are strongly advised communicate with any group member who may be working on a related feature (e.g., Profile </strong></td>

<strong>A2.2.  For the ONE (1) feature</strong> you have chosen, provide the following:

– <strong>Application Details:</strong>  A brief description of your application, including the following information for your application:

<ul>

 <li><strong>Target User Insight:</strong> A short description of your <em>target user base</em> (i.e., students, professionals, developers, age range, location), assumptions on why users would use this particular application, a description of any <strong>requirements or prerequisites</strong> that users must fulfil or have in order to be able to use your application’s features (i.e., specific knowledge, device, required training).</li>

 <li><strong>User-Centered Design Approach:</strong> Explain how your <em>user insights</em> were taken into consideration or used in the <em>design and development approach</em> for your application’s features (i.e., Information Architecture, design and layout, task flow).</li>

</ul>

   <td colspan="2" width="571"><strong>Note: Ensure you provide justifications for your design decisions. As previously </strong></td>

   <td width="386"> </td>

  </tr>

 </tbody>

– <strong>Application Workflow: </strong>Describe the application <em>workflow</em> for your project in regards to your interaction design approach to describe the front-end of your application, as well as the back-end processes and/or services in your application:

<ul>

 <li><strong>Interaction Design:</strong> A description of how your front-end is meant to work. How are processes triggered and handled?</li>

</ul>

Provide graphs or figures that illustrate how the backend of your application <em>processes and services</em> work (i.e., click streams, user task flow diagrams). A completed <em>use case</em> for each of the features you have chosen for this assignment, your use cases must include both normal and alternate flows. Use cases must also define the scenario relevant to the specific use cases as well as identify any user personas for whom the application is intended.

<ul>

 <li><strong>Process and Service Workflow:</strong> a description of how your back-end (in regards to the ONE feature you have chosen) is meant to work. How are processes triggered and handled? Provide graphs or figures that illustrate how the backend of your application processes and services work (e.g., workflow diagrams). A diagram detailing the expected file and folder structure for your intended features.</li>
